# VR Design Lab To-do list

## To-do:
- Get reticle to draw always in front of everything else.  Not sure how to do this, but Google Design lab seems to do this.
- Lab 6-10 forest scene, or make 5 mini scenes that demonstrate the labs differently
- Lab 3, train models still waiting for Blake
- Need better button graphics for Reset, Home, Next. (ask dara)
- Test and fix reset button for every lab.
- Nicer backgrounds and floors
- HTC Vive support (take code to workshop)
- Signs left to create in photoshop
- Polish/Animations/FadeIn/Outs to make things nicer


## Notes:
- To move camera around easily with mouse.  Click the App Boot Strap object in the scene, check the Build for Cardboard checkbox. Then run and hold down the Control key and move the mouse to steer camera.
